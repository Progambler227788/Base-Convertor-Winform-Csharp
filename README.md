# Convertor-of-Bases-2-8-10-16-
This is a software application created using C# Winform. 
The application uses listbox, combobox, buttons, and textboxes to allow users to perform various functions.

*****************Features*****************
The application allows users to enter numbers and convert them to various bases (binary, decimal, hexadecimal).
The length of the textboxes used for input is displayed on the screen.
